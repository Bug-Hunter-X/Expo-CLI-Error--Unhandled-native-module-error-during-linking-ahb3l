This error typically arises when you try to use a feature or module from a library that isn't properly installed or linked within your Expo project.  Common scenarios involve using native modules or those requiring linking, which don't automatically work in Expo's managed workflow.  The exact manifestation of the error varies depending on the module, but it often results in runtime crashes or build failures.  Let's say you try to use a camera library improperly.
