The corrected version uses an Expo-compatible camera library or manages the native module integration correctly according to Expo's documentation.  If using a camera module, ensure it's installed correctly and the permissions are set up.

```javascript
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker'; // Use Expo's ImagePicker

async function takePicture(){
  // ...use ImagePicker to avoid linking issues...
}
```
If the issue persists with a specific library, refer to its documentation for explicit Expo integration instructions.
